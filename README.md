## Problem Statement

The United Kingdom experienced one of its harshest winters in decades at the end of 2010, with temperatures dropping below -10°C (14°F) in some areas and persistent snowfalls across the country, including London. This unprecedented cold spell led to major disruptions in the London Underground network due to the accumulation of snow and ice on tracks, affecting both the trains and stations. The most severe period, with widespread closures and disruptions occured in December 13-20, 2010. In response to the severe winter disruption, the government and Transport for London (TfL) implemented various measures to mitigate the impact and restore normal services.

While it’s challenging to predict future events, experts believe that severe winter conditions like those experienced in 2010 could occur again in the near future, with climate change contributing to weather extremes

## Aim and Objectives

This study aims o analyze the London Underground network's performance during Business-as-Usual (BAU) and disruption scenarios in December 2010 and December 2024. The output of this study will evaluate the effectiveness of government measures during the 2010 disruption and provide actionable insights to improve resilience against future winter disruptions.

This objectives of this study:

- Develop network analysis on underground network during BAU (business-as-usual) on 2010 December
- Develop network analysis on underground network during winter disruption on 2010 December
- Evaluate government’s measure on the 2010 December travel disruption
- Develop network analysis on underground network during BAU (business-as-usual) on 2024 December
- Simulate network analysis on underground network during winter disruption on 2024 December, based on scenario:
    - Stations closure and line disrupted on 2010 December case
    - Worst case condition where all track above the ground will be icy and disrup the train
- Suggesting action to be taken to to alleviate congestion and minimize delays within Underground network

## Data

1. Underground station and lines in 2010 and 2024
2. Underground trips in December 13th 2010
3. Projection on undeground trip in December 13th 2024 or Underground trip in December 13th 2023

## Scenario

### 2010

Disrupted line:

- **Central Line:** Closed from West Ruislip to North Acton due to ice on tracks.
- **Metropolitan Line:** Sections closed, particularly north of Harrow-on-the-Hill, where heavy snow accumulated on tracks.
- **Northern Line:** Partial closure between Mill Hill East and Finchley Central because of ice build-up.
- **London Overground:** Severe closures, especially in suburban areas like Watford Junction, where trains couldn't operate due to snow and ice.

Closed Station:

- **Epping Station:** On the Central Line, Epping experienced closures due to snowdrifts blocking platforms and tracks.
- **Harrow-on-the-Hill:** Metropolitan Line disruptions led to full station closures.
- **Mill Hill East:** Northern Line closure caused by icy conditions.
- **Richmond and Stratford:** Affected by snow, leading to station shutdowns and limited accessibility.

Worst case scenario on 2024:

- Heavy snow accumulated on all tracks above the ground
- Stations located on the over ground tracks are closed
